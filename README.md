## 🧭 Project Summary

The portal was built to streamline interactions between customers and the SpectraLab team. It features two distinct user experiences:

- **Customers** can:
  - Track equipment orders and service status
  - Submit service requests
  - View product warranty and logistics info
  - Manage their profile

- **Admins** can:
  - Manage work orders and repair status
  - Review and fulfill equipment orders
  - Handle customer service requests
  - Maintain internal rosters and account information
  - Manage user access in the organization
**Based on the different roles of users, they would have different access to the functions mentioned above**
